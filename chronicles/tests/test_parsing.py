    should pass, because without explicitely setting lxml as the parser,
    bs4 gueses it. 
    If lxml is installed, running this test should produce following warning:

    GuessedAtParserWarning: 
    No parser was explicitly specified, 
    so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("lxml"). 
    This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, 
    or in a different virtual environment, 
    it may use a different parser and behave differently.
